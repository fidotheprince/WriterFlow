# WriterFlow
WritersFlow is a tool to help clear your writers block.

The app is currentlty being build on Visual Studios Mac. Accordingly, I am creating all changes to the application in a .sl file. The specific updates are being rendered within the WriterFlow folder. 

Moreover, the main files to look at to understand the functionality of the application will be the following. 

HomeController.cs (C#)

All .cshtml files (Razor, JS, jQuery) 

Model, .cs file

As of right now, the model represents a string, writing prompt(s), that a user can apply to solve their writer's block. 
 

Best,
